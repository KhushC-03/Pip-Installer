# Pip-Installer
This is my OS pip package installer application, with a pip update feature.
This is differnt to others as I have implemented a feature which retrieves data from the pip website which can determine whether the package exsits or not.
You can install as many packages as you want as it loops through each one.
You can also update your pip.
You can also see all your installed packages and delete ones you no longer want
This is easier than opening your cmd and typing in 'pip install'
